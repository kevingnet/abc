------------------------------------------
M: meter
a) none: omits meter
b) symbols give common time: 6/8, 4/4, C, C|, 2+3+2/8
c) when undefined free meter is assumed, and bar lines can be placed anywhere

------------------------------------------
L: unit note length
a) note values can have symbols:
b) if undefined, the note length will be calculated from M, 
Commonly used values for unit note length are L:1/4 - quarter note (crotchet), L:1/8 - eighth note (quaver) and 
L:1/16 - sixteenth note (semi-quaver). L:1 (whole note) - or equivalently L:1/1, L:1/2 (minim), L:1/32 (demi-semi-quaver), 
L:1/64, L:1/128, L:1/256 and L:1/512 are also available, although L:1/64 and shorter values are optional and may not be 
provided by all software packages.
If there is no L: field defined, a unit note length is set by default, based on the meter field M:. This default is calculated 
by computing the meter as a decimal: if it is less than 0.75 the default unit note length is a sixteenth note; if it is 0.75 or 
greater, it is an eighth note. For example, 2/4 = 0.5, so, the default unit note length is a sixteenth note, while for 4/4 = 1.0, 
or 6/8 = 0.75, or 3/4= 0.75, it is an eighth note. For M:C (4/4), M:C| (2/2) and M:none (free meter), the default unit note length 
is 1/8.
A meter change within the body of the tune will not change the unit note length.

------------------------------------------
Q: tempo  
a) beats per minute: Q:1/2=120 means 120 half-note beats per minute.
b) There may be up to 4 beats in the definition, e.g: Q:1/4 3/8 1/4 3/8=40 play the tune as if Q:5/4=40 was written
c) may be preceded or followed by an optional text string, enclosed by quotes "Allegro" 1/4=120

b) static macro: m: ~G3 = G{A}G{F}G
   search and replace on its internal copy of the text before passing that to the parser which plays the tune
c) transposing macro: same as above, to replace regular notes


------------------------------------------
Pitch
a) lower octaves use comma and higher apostrophe, AFTER A NOTE
   Programs should be able to to parse any combinations of , and ' signs appearing after the note. For example C,', 
   (C comma apostrophe comma) has the the same meaning as C, (C comma) and (uppercase) C' (C apostrophe) should have 
   the same meaning as (lowercase) c.

------------------------------------------
Accidentals
a) symbols ^, = and _ are used (before a note) to notate respectively a sharp, natural or flat. 
   Double sharps and flats are available with ^^ and __ respectively

------------------------------------------
Note Lengths
a) set in the L: field or, if the L: field does not exist, inferred from the M: field
b) single letter in the range A-G, a-g then represents a note of this length, if the unit note length is an eighth note, 
   DEF represents 3 eighth notes
c) differing lengths can be obtained by simply putting a multiplier after the letter. Thus if the unit note length is 1/16, 
   A or A1 is a sixteenth note, A2 an eighth note
d) To get shorter notes, divide them - e.g. if A is an eighth note, A/2 is a sixteenth note, A3/2 is a dotted 
   eighth note, A/4 is a thirty-second note. A/ is shorthand for A/2 and similarly A// = A/4, etc.

------------------------------------------
Broken rhythm
a) abc notation uses a > to mean 'the previous note is dotted, the next note halved' and 
   < to mean 'the previous note is halved, the next dotted'
The following lines all mean the same thing (the third version is recommended):
L:1/16
a3b cd3 a2b2c2d2
L:1/8
a3/2b/2 c/2d3/2 abcd
L:1/8
a>b c<d abcd

------------------------------------------
Rests
a) transcribed with a z or an x and can be modified in length in exactly the same way as normal notes

------------------------------------------
Clefs and transposition TRANSPOSE(change tone)
Clef and transposition information may be provided in the K: key and V: voice fields.
[clef=]<clef name>[<line number>][+8 | -8] [middle=<pitch>] [transpose=<semitones>] [octave=<number>] [stafflines=<lines>]

DO NOT AFFECT PLAYBACK?
<clef name> - may be treble, alto, tenor, bass, perc or none. perc selects the drum clef
[<line number>] - indicates on which staff line the base clef is written. Defaults are: treble: 2; alto: 3; tenor: 4; bass: 4
[middle=<pitch>] - is an alternate way to define the line number of the clef. The pitch indicates what note is displayed on 
  the 3rd line of the staff. Defaults are: treble: B; alto: C; tenor: A,; bass: D,; none: B. 
  This setting does not affect the playback.
[stafflines=<lines>] - the number of lines in the staff. The default is 5.

TRANSPOSE
*[+8 | -8] - draws '8' above or below the staff. The player will TRANSPOSE the notes one octave higher or lower.
*[transpose=<semitones>] - for playback, transpose the current voice by the indicated amount of semitones; 
 positive numbers transpose up, negative down. This setting does not affect the printed score. The default is 0.
*[octave=<number>] to raise (positive number) or lower (negative number) the music code in the current voice 
 by one or more octaves. This usage can help to avoid the need to write lots of apostrophes or commas to raise or lower notes.

------------------------------------------
Beams
Group notes by omitting space
Back quotes ` may be used freely between notes to be beamed, to increase legibility A2``B``C is equivalent to A2BC

------------------------------------------
Repeat/bar symbols
Symbol  Meaning
| bar line
|]  thin-thick double bar line
||  thin-thin double bar line
[|  thick-thin double bar line
|:  start of repeated section
:|  end of repeated section
::  start & end of two repeated sections

If an 'end of repeated section' is found without a previous 'start of repeated section', 

:: =   :| |: == :|: == :||:
|:: = repeat 2 |::: repeat 3 ...

Abc parsers should be quite liberal in recognizing bar lines. In the wild, bar lines may have any shape, using a 
sequence of | (thin bar line), [ or ] (thick bar line), and : (dots), e.g. |[| or [|::: .

------------------------------------------
First and second repeats
can be notated with the symbols [1 and [2   faf gfe|[1 dfe dBA:|[2 d2e dcB|]
| [1 = legal
| 1 = illegal
bar must preceed number without space

------------------------------------------
Variant endings
In combination with P: part notation, it is possible to notate more than two variant endings for a section 
that is to be repeated a number of times.

For example, if the header of the tune contains P:A4.B4 then parts A and B will each be played 4 times. 
To play a different ending each time, you could write in the tune:

P:A
<notes> | [1  <notes>  :| [2 <notes> :| [3 <notes> :| [4 <notes> |]
The Nth ending starts with [N and ends with one of ||, :| |] or [|. You can also mark a section as being used 
for more than one ending e.g.

[1,3 <notes> :|
plays on the 1st and 3rd endings and

[1-3 <notes> :|
plays on endings 1, 2 and 3. In general, '[' can be followed by any list of numbers and ranges as long as it 
contains no spaces e.g.

[1,3,5-7  <notes>  :| [2,4,8 <notes> :|

------------------------------------------
Ties and slurs
You can tie two notes of the same pitch together, within or between bars, with a - symbol, e.g. abc-|cba or c4-c4. 
The tie symbol must always be adjacent to the first note of the pair, but does not need to be adjacent to the second, 
e.g. c4 -c4 and abc|-cba are not legal 

Ties connect two successive notes of the same pitch, causing them to be played as a single note, 
while slurs connect the first and last note of any series of notes, and may be used to indicate phrasing, 
or that the group should be played legato

------------------------------------------
Grace notes
written by enclosing them in curly braces, {}

------------------------------------------
Duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.

Symbol  Meaning
(2  2 notes in the time of 3
(3  3 notes in the time of 2
(4  4 notes in the time of 3
(5  5 notes in the time of n
(6  6 notes in the time of 2
(7  7 notes in the time of n
(8  8 notes in the time of 3
(9  9 notes in the time of n

If the time signature is compound (6/8, 9/8, 12/8) then n is three, otherwise n is two.

More general tuplets can be specified using the syntax (p:q:r which means 'put p notes into the time of q for the next r notes'. 
If q is not given, it defaults as above. If r is not given, it defaults to p.

For example, (3 is equivalent to (3:: or (3:2 , which in turn are equivalent to (3:2:3, whereas (3::2 is equivalent to (3:2:2.

This can be useful to include notes of different lengths within a tuplet, for example (3:2:2 G4c2 or (3:2:4 G2A2Bc. 
It also describes more precisely how the simple syntax works in cases like (3 D2E2F2 or even (3 D3EF2. The number written over 
the tuplet is p.

Spaces that appear between the tuplet specifier and the following notes are to be ignored.

------------------------------------------
Decorations
Between !! 
Must parse them
Do they affect the music?

------------------------------------------
Chords and unisons
coded with [] symbols around the notes [CEGc]
there should be no spaces within the notation for a chord
notes within a chord should normally have the same length, but if not, the chord duration is that of the first note.
When both inside and outside the chord length modifiers are used, they should be multiplied. 
Example: [C2E2G2]3 has the same meaning as [CEG]6.

If the chord contains two notes of the same pitch, then it is a unison

HOWTO: 
-divide the time by all notes, since they all play the same length
-alternate among all notes playing only a smaller length, obtained by another accustically optimal divisor

------------------------------------------
Annotations
can be added above, below or on the staff in a similar way to chord symbols
string within double quotes is preceded by one of five symbols ^, _, <, > or @ 
controls where the annotation is to be placed; above, below, to the left or right 
respectively of the following note, rest or bar line
@ symbol leaves the exact placing of the string to the discretion of the interpreting program

------------------------------------------

Order of abc constructs
<grace notes>, <chord symbols>, <annotations>/<decorations>, <accidentals>, <note>, <octave>, <note length>
decorations: (e.g. Irish roll, staccato marker or up/downbow)
