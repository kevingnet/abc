# abc
Music Player for abc notation text files. Can play speaker tone, sound card tone or MIDI.

Written in python, this is still a work in progress. Sound card and MIDI player might need some extra configuration, speaker tone should work ok though.

The abc notation is quite extensive as music can be quite complex, I'm by no means a musician of any kind, this started as a little toy and it was so fun it made me go down the rabbit hole, specially since my kid likes to play piano and guitar and learned a bit of music notation, so I thought this would help him a bit.
